# The Story
I engineered some high traffic Applications for Porn Industrie which covers over 50% of the Whole Internet Traffic Today!
Then i heard about cloudflare and inspected what they offer first i tought its a lame product simply a dns with a web interface
but the more far i was going into the rabbit hole and my big collection of security and network stuff. I Started rethinking that!

I Found out that i need a Service like cloudflare but under Opensource to bundle all my Stuff under a Single Interface and Application Starting Point as Really all Starts with DNS and IP PORT Routing.

I Started many Projects befor and Concepts about Application Delivery for Large Organisations with Infinity Scale i wanted to Solve it all so i Simply merge it all into this Product that will be OpenSource and free for ever! Over 20 Years of Professional Really High Scale Traffic Solutions Done by a Single Professional! So i really sutdied it and know it all!

I also offer my expirence and Hosting Abilitys as a Enterprise Plan Serivce and also for normal None Tech Customers.
